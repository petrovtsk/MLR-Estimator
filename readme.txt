This repository contains simulation files used to perform performance evaluation of the MLR estimator presented in the section 4 of the paper "Tibor Petrov, Ilya Finkelberg, Peter Počta, Ľuboš Buzna, Nina Zarkhin, Ayelet Gal-Tzur and Tomer Toledo. An analytical approach to the estimation of vehicular communication reliability for intersection control applications. 
The repository contains two workspaces. 

The folder "DSRC workspace" contains the simulation files used for the performance evaluation of the MLR estimator using DSRC communication technology. The folder "C-V2X workspace" contains the simulation files used for the performance evaluation of the MLR estimator using 4G-based and 5G-based C-V2X communication technology in infrastructural mode, i.e., using the Uu cellular interface. 

For more specific information about the prerequisite software needed to use these files, please refer to the readme files included in the workspace folders of each communication technology.
